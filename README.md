# Normality-Voices-Selection
Setup and/or Toggle game voices (US/UK) and set game audio (stereo or mono) for the game Normality.

https://www.gog.com/game/normality

This program can toggle between UK and USA voices for the game.
It can also set the game sound to be either Stereo or Mono (default).

By default, the GOG and Steam versions of the game come with the original UK voices.
Many Americans are familiar with the USA voices instead.

If you have the original CD with the American voices, then you could use that with this program if you wish to toggle between.
Or if you have obtained the 'NormalityUsVoicesPatch.zip' (provided by Sweetz for GOG version), you could extract that into the game's main folder, then run this program there.

If patching, then click the SETUP VOICES button first and wait until the resulting console window processes have finished and it closes. American Voices should now be the default, and a user can change that at the click of a button.

Changing the audio can also be done clicking the available button.
PLEASE NOTE - This program only changes 3 values for audio, two in the 'CONFIG.INI' file and one only in the 'dosboxNORMAL.conf' file. This is all that needed to be changed with my game install. If it is otherwise on yours, please let me know. Other than creating file backups, my program does not store original data/values, so I do not want to mess with whatever a user's settings might be.

NOTE - The CLEANUP button removes (deletes) all files extracted from the 'NormalityUsVoicesPatch.zip' file ... so perhaps keep a backup of that zip file.

THANKS to Sweetz (patch) and Nilex (audio).
